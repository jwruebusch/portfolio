            Hello!
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a seasoned Developer Lead specializing in building and optimizing purchasing applications. With a robust background in
            Java/Spring backends and Angular frontends, I thrive on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that streamline business processes. I bring a strong focus on clean code principles, maintaining high standards that enhance code readability, maintainability, and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my current role, I oversee the development of purchasing systems that integrate seamlessly with our backend, ensuring they meet both technical and user requirements. I lead a talented team through every phase of the development lifecycle, from architecture and design to deployment and beyond. My work emphasizes creating a smooth and unified experience across our applications, prioritizing both robustness and responsiveness.
        </p>
        Beyond technical skills, I’m passionate about fostering a collaborative, growth-oriented team environment where developers can innovate and excel. I believe that strong communication and a shared vision are key to delivering impactful software solutions.
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me exploring new technologies, working out, or enjoying quality time with my family and our dog.
        </p>

        <p>
            I look forward to connecting and sharing how my skills and experience can help drive value in future projects!
